### 🔬 Research Background

My research focuses on theoretical and computational studies of

- Quantum transport
- Phonon transport

I work on implementing physical models and analyzing transport properties
using numerical simulations.

### 💻 Technical Skills

- Python for scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- C / C++ for numerical and performance-critical implementations
- Numerical linear algebra
- Experience with molecular dynamics simulations using LAMMPS
<!--
- Basic implementation of Green's function methods
-->
